# CRUD-film
This project is a simple console-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a list of films in Java. The project includes the following components:

Film class: Represents a film with properties such as ID, title, director, genre, and release year. The class contains getter and setter methods to access and modify these properties.
FilmManager class: Manages the list of films and provides methods for CRUD operations. The class contains methods for adding a film (create), retrieving a film (read), updating a film (update), and deleting a film (delete). The class also includes a method for printing all films (read) in the list.
Main class: The entry point of the application. The class contains a main method that initializes the FilmManager object and provides a simple console-based user interface for interacting with the application. Users can create new films, print all films, and exit the application.
